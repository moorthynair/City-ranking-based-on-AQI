# City-ranking-based-on-AQI
#The code facilitates in developing a city wise ranking on the basis of retreived Air Quality Index (AQI) data.

India, currently is operating over 300+ stations over 150+ cities across the country. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) facilitates in daily assessment of Air Quality Index based on the guildiness set by the Goverment of India. In this reagrds, as on today (03-01-2022) on a daily basis AQI of 100+ cities are reported. In the year 2015, The country has approxiametly 35 stations covering over 20 cities and ranking could be carried out manually on the basis of daily AQI bulletin released. Considering the upgradiation in CAAQMS network over the larger geographical extent of the country, performing the conventional techniques is challenging as it is laborous and time consuming with gretaer risk of human error. To resolve this issue, a python based code was developed. 

_Essential datset/libraries for performing the analysis_
1. City wise AQI ranking 
2. Python IDE
3. Tabula to read pdf (If city rankings are saved in pdf)
4. Pandas
5. Numpy
